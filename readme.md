# deez-steraunts

I built this project over the course of the back-end dev unit of Galvanize to practice many of the concepts we were learning in class. Over the course of the unit, we learned node and express, how to work with databases, how to create a CRUD (create-read-edit-delete) app, swig, the concept of encryption and security, and authentication with passport. Certain actions are restricted to users with certain rights.


### Within the app:

1. Only signed in users may add reviews.

1. Only the admin may create, update, or delete a restaurant.
